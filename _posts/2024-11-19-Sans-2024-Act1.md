# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2024 - Act 1

SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2024 Act 1 consists of **4 challenges** which can be solved in an easy (silver medal) or hard way (gold medal). Through this write-up, we will cover both solutions for the four challenges.

# cURLing Easy
For the easy challenge, we need to pass all the levels proposed in the challenge. Each level consists of specific use cases involving the `curl` tool. Here are the flags to consider in the challenge:

| Flag           | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-k`           | Allow insecure connections to succeed                         |
| `-d`           | Send specified data in POST request                           |
| `-b`           | Supply cookie with request                                    |
| `-i`           | Include protocol response headers in the output               |
| `-H`           | Headers to supply with request.                               |
| `--path-as-is` | Do not handle sequences like /../ or /./ in the given URL path. |


# cURLing Hard
For the hard challenge, we need to follow the instructions outlined in the file `HARD-MODE.txt`:

The solutions for it are:
``` shell-session
curl -k -d "skip=bow" -b "end=10" -H "Hack: 12ft" https://curlingfun:9090
curl -k --path-as-is https://curlingfun:9090/../../etc/button
curl -k -L https://curlingfun:9090/GoodSportsmanship
```

# Frosty Keypad Easy
For the easy challenge, we need to solve a cryptography puzzle based on the **Ottendorf Cypher**. Now, we need to interpret the clues we have:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad1.PNG)

The interpretation is:

- 1st Number: represents the PAGE
- 2nd Number: represents the WORD
- 3rd Number: represents the LETTER 

So, we need to find a book to decyrpt the message. If we explore the sorroundings, we eventually find it here:

Next, we decrypt the message and find the word is **SANTA** (with 5 letters, as the password we are finding).

But! We need to discard some numbers to make it easier for us to find the digit password. We go deep in the code through the developers tools, and find a `uv-flash`:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad3.PNG)

So let's try to activate it through the console:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad4.png)

The highlighted numbers are **2678**, and these need to be linked to the word **SANTA**.

To solve this, the first idea was to assign one number to each letter, following the order they appear in the alphabet:

| Letter | Digit |
| ------ | ----- |
| A      | 2     |
| N      | 6     |
| S      | 7     |
| T      | 8     |

We then enter this code into the keypad:

And it worked!

# Frosty Keypad Hard
For the hard challenge, we need to find another valid combination with the numbers **2678**. So let's write a Python program to get all the possible combinations:
```python
import itertools

# Define the digits
digits = ['2', '8', '7', '6']

# Generate all possible 5-digit combinations (repetition allowed)
combinations = itertools.product(digits, repeat=5)

# Write the combinations to a file
with open("5_digit_numbers.txt", "w") as file:
    for combination in combinations:
        number = ''.join(combination)  # Join tuple into a string
        file.write(number + "\n")

print("All possible 5-digit numbers have been written to '5_digit_numbers.txt'.")
```

We have the file `5_digit_numbers.txt` which contains the 1024 possibilities (4^5). Let's use Burp suite to send a request per each possibiltity.

First, we are going to intercept one normal request with the **Proxy** and send it to the **Intruder**. Then, we need to add the Payload and specify where we want to send it (add symbol §).

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad_h1.png)

Second, we will load our `5_digit_numbers.txt` file as the payload for the Intruder.

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad_h2.png)

As we can see, we have load our 1024 possibilities

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad_h3.png)

Now, we need to set up a timer between the request because it only accepts 1 request per second. So let's go to the **Resource Pool** (at the right of the payload section), and configure our timer.

![image](/assets/img/20241119/keypad_h4.png)

Finally, we start our attack (it should take a maximum of 21 minutes) and wait to receive a 200 status code.

# Hardware Hacking 101 Part 1 Easy
For the easy challenge, first we need to recreate the image to get the clue. We get the files `heuristic_edge_detection.py` and `shreds.zip`. We run the `python` script and get the image:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw1.PNG)

We edit it (join the two parts and apply a mirror effect), and we can read it:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2.PNG)

This are the configurations we need to use to solve the challenge. We connect the cables correctly and send the message with the correct configuration (remember to set the power to 3V):

# Hardware Hacking 101 Part 1 Hard
For the hard challenge, we find the following code:

```javascript
// Build the URL with the request ID as a query parameter
// Word on the wire is that some resourceful elves managed to brute-force their way in through the v1 API.
// We have since updated the API to v2 and v1 "should" be removed by now.
// const url = new URL(`${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:${window.location.port}/api/v1/complete`);
const url = new URL(`${window.location.protocol}//${window.location.hostname}:${window.location.port}/api/v2/complete`);
```

From this, we see that it’s possible to use the `/api/v1/complete` endpoint for brute-forcing. However, since we already know the serial configuration, brute-forcing is unnecessary. Instead, we will modify the code to use the version 1 endpoint. Once this is done, we will send the connection with the correct parameters and retrieve the trophy.

# Hardware Hacking 101 Part 2 Easy
For the easy challenge, we start the system in default mode and run `history`:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_1.PNG)

Here we have the password! To pass the challenge we should modify the entry for card number 42 to grant access. Let's do it:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2.PNG)

# Hardware Hacking 101 Part 2 Hard
For the hard challenge, we need to access the database, but we don't know which database! Thankfully, the `slh --view-config` command gives us the databse name. Also, from the current directory, we can see there is a `.sqlite_history` file. So, let's try to connect with **sqlite3**

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2_h1.PNG)

So we are in! Now, we need to modify the database to add our custom HMAC. But first, let's take a look at the structure of the database:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2_h5.PNG)

Let's take a closer look at the `config` table:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2_h2.PNG)

Mmmm, here we see the structure of the HMAC -> {access_level}{uuid}. So first, let's find card 42 UUID:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2_h4.PNG)

Now, let's generate our HMAC with **CyberChef**. As secret key we will use the `hmac_secret` we have obtained before, and as the input we will put {1}{card_42_UUID}, since we want to give access 1 to that card:

![image](/assets/img/20241119/hw2_2_h3.PNG)

Finally, let's update the database and get that last challenge!
